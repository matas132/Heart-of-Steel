For many years there was only silence.
But before the silenceâ€¦ there was a song. 
The Song of Steel. 
You were Knight Alpha. The first. There were Three of You. One for each Gate of the Enemy.
The sound of Your steel against Your Enemies sang each day. 
All to protect the Last City. Omega. 
Your conductor was Jason. You moved in harmony under his direction.
Together You held back the Enemy.

But now, the Enemy has returned. 
The gas chamber coolants have oxidised. 
The charging protocols have been overridden. 
And the emergency overclocking has been authorised.
Jason is no more. 
Instead the progeny of Jason sits at your controls.
Your weapons have changed and so has the Enemy. 
Before there were Three of you. Now there is just One. You. But still there are Three Gates.
Omega needs You once more.
The silence has ended.
